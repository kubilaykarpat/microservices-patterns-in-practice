# Kotlin Hobby Project - Outbox and Saga Pattern
This project is a hobby implementation of the Outbox and Saga patterns using Kotlin. The design and concepts of these patterns are inspired by the book "Microservices Patterns: With Examples in Java" by Chris Richardson.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the usage of the Outbox and Saga patterns in a Kotlin application. The Outbox pattern is used to ensure reliable messaging and event-driven communication between microservices, while the Saga pattern helps to manage long-running transactions involving multiple microservices.

Implementations here are probably not very suitable for production environments but rather a demonstration for these patterns.
